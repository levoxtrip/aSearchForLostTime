If you have multiple levels of `ForEach` in VVVV and you pipe spread data through each level, you need to flatten the `Spread` in each `ForEach`.


Don't forget to pipe the values *through* the `if` otherwise they will not be saved.


You can't just add an element in a spread like in javascript. You first have to create the entry in the spread so there is space to add an actual value.
