# 25-06-25 - Today I Learned...
Today I learned again how to set the right path for your python version.

1. Find the Python installation path.

2. Add the Path to Windows:
  - `Win+R` and `sysdm.cpl` to open the system window.
  - Go to *Advanced Tab* and *Environment Variables*
  - Under *System Variables* find *Path* -> *Edit*
  - *New* and add the path to your Python
  - Also add the path to the *Scripts* folder in the python folder.

3. Restart terminal
