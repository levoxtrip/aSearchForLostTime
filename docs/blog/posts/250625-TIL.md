# 25-06-22 - Today I Learned...
I learned the hard way that you should run your python and AI projects in a virtual environment so they don't create problems with other dependencies.
`python -m venv env` with *env* as the name for the environment.

To run the environment you write `env\Scripts\activate.bat` or `env\Scripts\activate`.

With `deactivate` we simply can deactivate the virtual environment.

The packages and dependencies that we used in the environment we then can save in a `requirements.txt` file so if somebody else uses the project they can download themselves without us sending the dependencies.
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`
