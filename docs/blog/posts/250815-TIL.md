## TD and Stream Diffusion
In TouchDesigner Stream diffusion the `Step` parameter defines how close the output is to the original input. The higher the step value the closer it tries to go towards the orginal input.

If you want something really abstract you want values between 10-15

Also using a Feedback as the input for Stream Diffusion makes the transition smoother.

If you add some noise as background or multiply your input into sd with noise you get more detail. If you animate the noise it keeps the output moving a bit all the time.

## TD and Feedback Loop
Always try your feedback loops with 16bit or 32bit so your feedback comes back to true black after time.

## TD Panel
If you have multiple radio buttons inside a component and you want to access the current value of the radio value via scripting you can use `op('parentName').panel.radio`
