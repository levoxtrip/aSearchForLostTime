## Storytelling
- Eliptical narrative
- Documenting places that don't exist anymore
- Riddles and secrets to create curiosity
- Challenge the recipient to solve a problem
- Let people be able to decide over the flow of the experience
- Can I use humor/exaggeration to communicate the idea?

## Questioning

- Can you put the topic into a different time context?

- What is the discrepancy between topic 1 and topic 2?

- What object tells the story ?

- Why is this situation framed like it is?

- What is revealed or made tangible?

- What is unseen in this situation?

- Why humans do/don't ... ?





## Materials
Can I use an old/wasteful material and upcycle it to convey my idea?
