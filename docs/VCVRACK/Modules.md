# Modules

## VCA - Voltage Controlled Amplitude
Connect a control voltage signal or an envelope to modulate the amplitude of the input. The amplitude reacts according to modulation signal.


## VCF - Voltage Controlled Filter
The `VCF` has:
- LPF - Low Pass Filter - only low frequency can pass
- HPF - High Pass Filter - ony high frequency can pass

The filter have often their own envelopes to manipulate the cutoff.
