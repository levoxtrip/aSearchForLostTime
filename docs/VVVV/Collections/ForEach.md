# ForEach



![Naming Splicer Inputs/Outputs](../img/KeepInForEach.png)
## Defining which elements to keep
The `Keep` node in the `ForEach` region allows us to select which elements we want to stay and which to ignore. The output of the iteration gets plugged into the `Keep` and we pass the *Splicer Input* into the *Splicer Output*.

We can name the input & output splicers of the `ForEach` by double clicking the rectangle right from the splicer. Naming inputs and outputs improves readability and understanding.
