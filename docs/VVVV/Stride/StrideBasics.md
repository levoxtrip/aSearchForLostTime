# Stride Basics

## Stride Scene

### Entity

A *Scene* in Stride contains *Entities* which are the building blocks of the 3D scene - `Plane`, `Sphere`,`Box`, `Camera`, `Lights`.

Each entity can also be a parent of spread of child entities. We can plug them into the `Children` input of an entity. This also allows us to create herachies where the children transformations behave relative to the parent transformation. A way to group the children is either with `Cons` node or a `Spread`.

On the `Components` input of the entity we can add special behavior and functionality - for example physics behavior, Instancing and more.


## Stride Transformations
Stride has different ways to transform an entity. We can use `TransformSRT` but also use instead the *matrix operations* `Translation`,`Rotation`,`Scaling` of type `3D.Matrix` as well as `Translate`,`Rotate`,`Scale` of type `3D.Transform`.

==??? What is the actual different between them?===

## 2D Primitives 
In *Stride* we have the 2D primitives `Disc`,`Plane` and `RoundRectangle`

## 2D Meshes
If you specifically want to draw meshes you need a `MeshRenderer` which then gets connected to a `RenderEntity`.

## Draw Wireframe Mesh
To render as Mesh as wireframe we need to add `RasterizerStateDescription` and set the Fill mode to `Wireframe`. For the color of the wireframe we add a `ConstantColorShader`. The `Topology` parameter of the `MeshRenderer` allows different kinds of Wireframes. It is worth experimenting with them.

## 3D Primitives
Stride provides basic 3D primitives like `Box`,`Sphere`,`Cylinder`,`Cone`,`Torus` or `Capsule` as well as `GeoSphere`. These primitives are also available as Meshes.

## Instancing
There are several ways to instance shapes in VVVV.

### Instancing Spread Component
One way to instance shapes in VL.Stride is to use the `InstancingSpreadComponent`. For that we create *Transformation Matrix data* in a Sequence like a `Spread` and use it as the `Instance Transformations` input.
For a random position of our primitive we can for example use a `RandomSpread(3D)`, set its values in an `ForEach` to the `Translation` or `Rotation` and then use that data for the `Instance Transfromations` of the `InstancingSpreadComponent`.

To be able to use the data for the `Components` input of the primitive, with a `FromValue(Spread)` node, we need to convert it into `Spread<EntityComponents>`.

The `InstancingSpreadComponent` has a `ModelTransformUsage` parameter that allows to define how the world matrix data of the instanced shape gets multiplied with the transformations of the main instance.

Another option is to take
