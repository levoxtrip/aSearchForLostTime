# Split Mesh Into Its Components
We can split up a 3D mesh to use the positions of the vertices for instancing shapes and normals to rotate the instances.
Depending on what data you need there are different `MeshSplit` nodes. Useful in that situation is also the `MeshDescription` node that gives u information what data the mesh contains.
