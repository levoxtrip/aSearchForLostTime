# About Art

Art is there to generate meaning of our world

Art makes other worlds possible.

Artworks as creation of sketches that are ideas of our future.

Art as interactive and playful models where we can experience the changes of technology.

Artworks as simulations of future.


## Art as valve or escape
What if you use art as way to work on you trauma? 

What if you user your trauma as a topic in your artwork?

What if you create artworks as a diary?
