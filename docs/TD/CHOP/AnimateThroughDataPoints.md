# Animate Through Graphs of Data Points

Animating through graphs of datapoints in TouchDesigner allows us to visualize complex data in a dynamic and interactive way, helping to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that static representations may not reveal.
Steps to follow:
- Add Table data and convert to CHOP Data:

- Add `ConstantCHOP` and `SpeedCHOP` to control how was to go through Data.

- Connect `SpeedCHOP` to `LookupCHOP` and limit speed to loop through data
