# Kinect

The `KinectCHOP` has the option the get the values in `Image Space Positions` or in `World Space Positions`.

`World Space Positions` means that all values are in relation to the 3D space that the kinect tracks.

`Image Space Positions` gives you the coordinates in UV space of our screen.
