![Point Sprite Particle System Img1](../img/PointSpriteParticleSystem.png)

# Point Sprite Particle System
For Particle Systems we also can use a `PointSpriteMAT` which allows us to show a top as a particle image. We have to set in `ParticleSOP` `Particle Type` as `Render as Point Sprites`. 

In the `PointSpriteMAT` we can change the `Constant POint Scale` to change the size of the particle.
